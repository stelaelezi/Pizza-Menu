The Pizza Menu is a simple project built with React. I have created different components, such as:

Menu: Contains the menu items.
Header: Displays the title.
Footer: Includes the order button, which currently does nothing, and shows the open and close hours.
Additionally, I'm rendering a list of pizza elements using the map() method.
